**Heat Sink Surface Defect Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the surface defect detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 1000 images with 7118 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *stain area* and *scratch area*. There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the State Key Laboratories of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
