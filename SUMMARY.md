**Heat Sink Surface Defect Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 1000 images with 7118 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *stain area* and *scratch area*.

Images in the Heat Sink Surface Defect Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (1000 images). The dataset was released in 2022.
