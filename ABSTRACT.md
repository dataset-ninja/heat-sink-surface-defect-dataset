The authors of the **Heat Sink Surface Defect Dataset** delve into the significance of surface defect detection within industrial production, a factor crucial for product quality and production efficiency.

This dataset contains 1000 images of gold-plated tungsten-copper alloy heat sink surface defects and their annotation.

-Images are labeled into 3 categories:
0 - background (defect-free area)
1 - scratch area
2 - stain area
